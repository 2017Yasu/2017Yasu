Currently, I am involved in system development, mainly dealing with systems which assist making and managing document by using C# and SQL Server. As a university student, I studied a wide range of computational theories such as evolutionary computation, quantum informatics, data mining, and deep learning. I am personally interested in various cutting-edge technologies, so I have been studying blockchain and quantum computers, even though they are not so relevant to my work. I found myself good at learning a new programming language quickly when I started working. I have used programming languages such as Python, C, Java, C #, R, and Javascript before, and I have also studied TensorFlow, Unity, and SQL by myself.

When I was a student, I worked as a cram school part-time teacher and mainly taught English, science and mathematics to about 20 students. Thus, I am confident in my ability to nurture and lead people. Also, I contributed to the university basketball club as the vice-captain demonstrating my leadership skill. While studying abroad, I actively participated in basketball events and baking society, and enjoyed communicating with various people around the world.
